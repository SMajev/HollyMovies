## v2 Migration Guide

There are some breaking changes in v2. Configuration file from v1.x will not work, you will have to create new config file. Please read about config [here](https://notabug.org/sayem314/d-fi/src/master/docs/config.md). In this guide I will talk about CLI commands.

### Save Layout

| v1.x                |              v2.x               |                                                                                        Description |
| ------------------- | :-----------------------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| `-p save_to_folder` | `-o save_to_folder/{SNG_TITLE}` |            `-p, --path` was replaced with `-o, --output` with the ability to define save structure |
| `-d all`            |         `-i links.txt`          | `-d, --downloadmode` was replaced with `-i, --input-file` to download from your desired text files |
| N/A                 |        `-d, --headless`         |                                       Headless mode for downloading from scripts (quits once done) |
| `-n, --no-progress` |               N/A               |                                  Updated progress to be reliable hence not needing this in scripts |
| N/A                 |         `-U, --update`          |                                                            Downloads new updates (only for binary) |
| N/A                 |   `-rfp, --resolve-full-path`   |                            Uses full path location in playlist file (mandatory for plex like apps) |
| N/A                 |    `-cp, --create-playlist`     |                                                      Force create playlists for albums and artists |
| N/A                 |     `-conf, --config-file`      |                                                                         Specify custom config file |

v2 mainly focuses on faster performance, better reliablity and the ability to use on third party programs.
